# Sutil.Generator

[Sutil.Generator] is a project that aims to bring the goodness of [Web Components] to F# thanks to [Sutil]

Since Sutil is a pure F# And JS framework without other dependencies rather than Fable.Core and Feliz.Engine it allows itself to be quite interoperable with the rest of the web

In this page we're using HTML elements, [Shoelace], and [FAST] components, all in the same place they don't fight each other, they just work completely fine

See them working side by side below üëáüèΩ
