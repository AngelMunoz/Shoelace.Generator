# Sutil.Fast
[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Sutil.Fast?includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sutil.Fast)

**Sutil.Fast** is a small [Sutil] wrapper built on top of [FAST] a web component library.

**Sutil.Fast** is autogenerated thanks to the [Sutil.Generator] project. Sutil.Fast also adds some helpers to allow you interact in a seamless way with Sutil

### Installation

```sh
dotnet add package Sutil.Fast --version <VERSION>
pnpm install @microsoft/fast-components@<VERSION> @microsoft/fast-foundation lodash-es # or npm install @microsoft/shoelace@<VERSION>
```
If you are using [femto] then you just need to do

- `femto install Sutil.Fast --version <VERSION>`

# Getting Started

- [Components](#/fast/docs/components)


## Versioning
Sutil.Fast is built against the latest version of [Fast] in case there are bug fixes on the generator itself or additions for quality of life the nuget version will add a last dot and a number to indicate this was a new version of the generated package.

Example: 
- `Fast version: v1.21.6`

    **Normal Release ->** `Sutil.Fast version: v1.21.6`

- `Fast version: v1.21.6`
    **Sutil.Generator Fix/QL Update ->** `Sutil.Fast version: Fast version: v1.21.6.1`

This is expected to be done in rare ocations when a fix or QL update really is needed, for the most part most of the QL updates will be sent with the next Fast release to prevent distancing from the shoelace version
