# Sutil.Shoelace
[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Sutil.Shoelace?includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sutil.Shoelace)

**Sutil.Shoelace** is a small [Sutil] wrapper built on top of [Shoelace] a web component library.

**Sutil.Shoelace** is autogenerated thanks to the [Sutil.Generator] project which takes a similar approach used to generate the [official React components]. Sutil.Shoelace also adds some helpers to allow you interact in a seamless way with Sutil

## Versioning
Sutil.Shoelace is built against the latest version of [Shoelace] in case there are bug fixes on the generator itself or additions for quality of life the nuget version will add a last dot and a number to indicate this was a new version of the generated package.

Example: 
- `Shoelace version: v2.0.0-beta.43`

    **Normal Release ->** `Sutil.Shoelace version: v2.0.0-beta.43`

- `Shoelace version: v2.0.0-beta.43`
    **Sutil.Generator Fix/QL Update ->** `Sutil.Shoelace version: Shoelace version: v2.0.0-beta.43.1`

This is expected to be done in rare ocations when a fix or QL update really is needed, for the most part most of the QL updates will be sent with the next Shoelace release to prevent distancing from the shoelace version
